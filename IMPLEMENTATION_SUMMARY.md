# Email Auto-fill Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented auto-fill email functionality for the early access signup flow when users are redirected from the login page.

## Changes Made

### 1. EarlyAccessLogin.tsx
- Modified the "Get Early Access" button to pass the entered email as a URL parameter
- Changed navigation from `/early-access` to `/early-access?email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}`

### 2. EarlyAccessSignup.tsx
- Added `useSearchParams` to read the email from URL parameters
- Added visual feedback showing "We're setting up your early access for [email]"
- Passed `initialEmail` and `autoSubmit` props to SmartEmailCapture component

### 3. SmartEmailCapture.tsx
- Added two new props:
  - `initialEmail`: Pre-fills the email field
  - `autoSubmit`: Automatically submits the form when email is pre-filled
- Added `useEffect` to trigger auto-submission after 500ms delay
- Set initial state to expanded when auto-submit is enabled

## User Flow
1. User enters email on login page (`/login`)
2. If email is not found in early access list, they see a message
3. User clicks "Get Early Access" button
4. They are redirected to `/early-access?email=their@email.com`
5. The email field is pre-filled and automatically submitted
6. User receives verification email via the `capture-email` edge function

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter an email that's not in the early access list
3. Click "Continue with email"
4. Click "Get Early Access" when prompted
5. Verify the email is auto-filled and submitted
6. Check that the verification email is sent

## Edge Functions Used
- `send-verification-code`: Sends OTP codes for login
- `capture-email`: Captures new early access leads and sends magic link emails
- `verify-otp-code`: Verifies OTP codes
- `verify-magic-link`: Verifies magic link tokens
