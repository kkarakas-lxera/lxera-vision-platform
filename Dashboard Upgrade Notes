### **Current Metrics Overview (What’s Already Strong)**

#### **Dashboard (Home View)**

## Total Employees

## CV Analysis

## Skills Match

## Career Readiness Score

## Positions

## Critical Gaps

## Active Learning (Courses in Progress)

## Recent Activity Timeline

## Position Skills Coverage Table

### **What’s Missing or Needs Enhancement**

#### **1\. Skills Gap Trend Over Time**

## Why: To track improvement post-learning initiatives

## Suggestion: Add a Skills Gap Trend (line chart) showing

## Avg. skill match (%) over past 30/60/90 days

## of critical skills reduced over time

#### **2\. Position Readiness Index**

## Why: Managers want to know which job roles are “deployment-ready.”

## Suggestion: Add a Readiness Score per Position, based on

## Avg. match %

## of employees assigned

## of training hours completed

#### **3\. Learning Metrics Enhancement**

## **Currently:**

## Total Courses

## Active Learners

## Completion Rate: %

## Avg. Progress: %**  

These metrics are good structurally, but should evolve to include:**

## Avg. Time to Completion

## Engagement Score (login frequency, course interactions)

## Most Recommended Course by Role

## Learning ROI Estimate (check below)

####

#### **4\. Skills Inventory Health**

## Why: Visualizing what skills the organization already has vs. what’s required

## Suggestion: Add

## Top 10 Most Common Skills in Org

## Top 10 Missing Skills Across All Positions

## Skill Redundancy Warning (too many people with same skills)

#### **5\. Career Progression Indicators**

## Why: Connect skill-building to advancement

## Suggestion: Add “Career Path Readiness”

## For each employee: % completion of skill requirements to level up

## Badge: Ready for Promotion or Almost There

### **ROI-Focused Metrics**

### **1\. Learning Engagement**

_Are employees actually using the platform and content?_

- **Learning Hours per Employee  
    **→ Tracks total time invested in learning  
    _(e.g. Avg: 4.2 hrs/month)_
- **Course Enrollment vs. Completion Rate  
    **→ Indicates value and relevance  
    _(e.g. 72% completion = healthy learning culture)_
- **Drop-Off Points  
    **→ Where people lose interest—useful to refine content

### **2\. Skill Acquisition & Application**

_Are employees gaining new skills that matter?_

- **% Skill Gap Reduction (Pre vs. Post-Learning)  
    **→ Show how much closer employees are to role fit  
    _(e.g. Senior Software Engineer: +25% skill match after 3 courses)_
- **Average Skills Gained per Employee  
    **_(e.g. +3 new relevant skills acquired in Q2)_
- **Certification or Badge Completion Rate  
    **_(e.g. 40% earned internal AI Fundamentals badge)_

### **3\. Business Impact Proxies**

_How does learning influence real business outcomes?_

We may not always have access to performance data directly, but you can track proxies:

- **Role Readiness Index  
    **→ % of employees fully matched to role requirements  
    _(e.g. 6 of 10 Data Analysts are now “Job Ready”)_
- **Time-to-Productivity  
    **→ Measure days from hire to minimum role fit (e.g., 70% skill match)  
    _(e.g. Reduced from 90 to 50 days = direct productivity gain)_
- **Internal Mobility Rate  
    **→ % of employees promoted or moved to new roles post-training  
    _(e.g. 18% mobility rate this quarter vs. 9% last)_

### **4\. Cost & ROI Estimation**

### _What’s the monetary value created vs. cost?_

If we want to show **training ROI as a dollar figure**, calculate:

#### **ROI Formula**

ROI (%) = (Monetary Benefit - Training Cost) / Training Cost \* 100

Then, visualize this based on:

- **Training Cost per Employee**
- **Estimated Productivity Gain per Employee** (e.g. $3,000 avg. based on internal benchmarks)
- **Aggregate Estimated ROI (%)**

## **Recommendation: 5 ROI Metrics to Show First**

1. **Skill Gap Reduction (%)**
2. **Avg. Time to Role Readiness**
3. **Internal Promotion/Mobility Rate**
4. **Completion Rate vs. Enrollment**
5. **Learning ROI ($ or %) Estimate**

###

### **Example:**

### **1\. Learning Efficiency**

- **Learning Hours per Employee: 4.2 hours/month**
- **Completion Rate: 72%**
- **Drop-off Rate: 15%  
    Helps track engagement and adoption across the company.**

### **2\. Skill Readiness Progress**

- **Skill Gap Reduction: 35% average improvement**
- **Role Readiness Score: 65%**
- **Avg. Skills Gained: 3.4 per employee  
    Illustrates how learning maps to job preparedness.**

### **3\. Business Impact**

- **Time to Productivity: 50 days**
- **Internal Mobility Rate: 18%  
    Shows how learning drives internal growth and faster onboarding.**

### **4\. ROI Overview**

- **Training Cost per Employee: $500**
- **Estimated Value Created: $1500**
- **ROI: 200%  
    A direct monetary view to justify L&D investment.**

### **Suggestions:**

## **Automate Learning-to-Performance Stories**

Help HR explain the value of learning to executives.

**Suggestion**:

- Create “Impact Cards” per department or role:  
    “Sales Team: Skill gap reduced 32%. Avg. readiness up 18%. $ estimated gain: $12K/month.”
- Trigger these based on:
  - New course completions
  - Closed skill gaps
  - Internal moves

## **Introduce ROI Benchmarks & Alerts**

Add more intelligence, not just dashboards.

**Suggestion**:

- Alert HR when:
  - Time to productivity exceeds target
  - Learning hours are high, but impact is low
  - Role readiness drops after training
- Benchmark against:
  - Internal goals
  - Peers/roles
  - LXERA’s own anonymized database

## **Build an ROI Readiness Model**

Let companies assess themselves.

**Suggestion**:

- Add an “ROI Maturity Score” tool that scores companies on:
  - Skill tracking
  - Goal alignment
  - Course-to-role effectiveness
  - Performance link

## **Tiered Dashboard Modes**

1. **Core View**: Skills match, readiness, course stats
2. **Enterprise View**: includes skill gap trends, mobility, impact cards, includes ROI models, alerts, benchmarks, maturity score
