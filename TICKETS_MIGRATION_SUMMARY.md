# Tickets System Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the `demo_requests` table to a unified `tickets` system that supports multiple ticket types: demo requests, contact sales, and early access requests.

## Database Changes

### 1. Table Migration
- **Old table**: `demo_requests`
- **New table**: `tickets`
- **Migration date**: 2025-01-04

### 2. New Schema
The `tickets` table now includes:
- All original `demo_requests` columns
- `ticket_type` (ENUM: 'demo_request', 'contact_sales', 'early_access')
- `budget_range` (for contact_sales)
- `timeline` (for contact_sales)
- `use_case` (for contact_sales and early_access)
- `referral_source` (for early_access)

### 3. Indexes
All indexes were successfully renamed and new composite indexes added:
- `idx_tickets_ticket_type`
- `idx_tickets_type_status`
- `idx_tickets_type_submitted`

### 4. RLS Policies
Updated all Row Level Security policies to work with the new `tickets` table:
- Admins can view all tickets
- Admins can insert tickets
- Admins can update tickets
- Service role can insert tickets

## Edge Functions

### 1. Updated Functions
- **submit-demo-request**: Updated to support `ticketType` parameter and insert into `tickets` table

### 2. New Functions
- **submit-contact-sales**: Handles contact sales requests with budget and timeline information
- **submit-early-access**: Handles early access requests with referral source tracking

## Frontend Changes

### 1. TypeScript Types
- Updated `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` to reflect the new `tickets` table structure
- Added proper TypeScript enums for ticket types

### 2. Services
- Created new `ticketService.ts` with full support for all ticket types
- Updated `demoRequestService.ts` to re-export from `ticketService` for backward compatibility
- All existing code using `demoRequestService` will continue to work without changes

### 3. Backward Compatibility
The migration maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing demo request functionality remains unchanged
- All existing API calls will continue to work
- Default `ticket_type` is 'demo_request' if not specified

## Testing Results

Successfully tested:
- Creating tickets of all three types
- Type-specific fields are properly stored
- Indexes are working correctly
- RLS policies are enforced
- Edge functions deployed and functional

## Next Steps

1. Update frontend forms to use the new ticket types
2. Create admin UI for managing different ticket types
3. Add reporting dashboard for ticket analytics
4. Consider adding more ticket types as needed (e.g., 'support_request', 'feedback')

## Migration Rollback (if needed)

To rollback this migration:
```sql
-- Rename table back
ALTER TABLE tickets RENAME TO demo_requests;

-- Drop new columns
ALTER TABLE demo_requests 
DROP COLUMN ticket_type,
DROP COLUMN budget_range,
DROP COLUMN timeline,
DROP COLUMN use_case,
DROP COLUMN referral_source;

-- Rename indexes back
ALTER INDEX tickets_pkey RENAME TO demo_requests_pkey;
ALTER INDEX idx_tickets_status RENAME TO idx_demo_requests_status;
ALTER INDEX idx_tickets_submitted_at RENAME TO idx_demo_requests_submitted_at;
ALTER INDEX idx_tickets_email RENAME TO idx_demo_requests_email;
ALTER INDEX idx_tickets_company RENAME TO idx_demo_requests_company;

-- Drop new indexes
DROP INDEX idx_tickets_ticket_type;
DROP INDEX idx_tickets_type_status;
DROP INDEX idx_tickets_type_submitted;

-- Recreate original RLS policies
-- (See original policies in migration file)
```

## Notes

- All existing data was preserved during migration
- No data loss occurred
- The system is fully operational with the new structure
