# Unified Tickets System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a unified tickets system that consolidates demo requests, contact sales, and early access submissions into a single `tickets` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250204_create_unified_tickets.sql`
- Creates new `tickets` table with:
  - `ticket_type` field to distinguish between types
  - Common fields for all ticket types
  - Metadata field for type-specific data
  - RLS policies for security
  - Performance indexes
  - Backward compatibility view for `demo_requests`

### 2. Service Layer
- **New Service**: `src/services/ticketService.ts`
  - Unified service for all ticket types
  - Type-safe interfaces for each ticket type
  - Methods for CRUD operations and statistics
  - Backward compatibility methods

- **Updated Service**: `src/services/demoRequestService.ts`
  - Now acts as a wrapper around ticketService
  - Maintains backward compatibility
  - All methods delegate to ticketService

### 3. Components

#### New Components
- `src/components/admin/TicketsManagement/TicketsTable.tsx`
  - Unified table with type filtering
  - Visual indicators for ticket types (ðŸŽ¯ ðŸ’° ðŸš€)
  - Priority badges

- `src/components/admin/TicketsManagement/TicketDetailModal.tsx`
  - Supports all ticket types
  - Type-specific field display
  - Priority management

- `src/components/admin/TicketsManagement/TicketStats.tsx`
  - Statistics cards for all ticket types
  - Real-time counts

- `src/components/admin/TicketsManagement/CompactTicketsTable.tsx`
  - Compact view for dashboards

#### Updated Components
- `src/components/ContactSalesModal.tsx`
  - Now saves to database using ticketService
  - Creates `contact_sales` type tickets

- `src/components/WaitlistModal.tsx`
  - Now saves to database using ticketService
  - Creates `early_access` type tickets

- `src/components/DemoModal.tsx`
  - Updated to use ticketService
  - Creates `demo_request` type tickets

### 4. Pages

#### New Pages
- `src/pages/admin/Tickets.tsx`
  - Unified tickets management page
  - Filtering by type and status
  - Export functionality

#### Updated Pages
- `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`
  - Shows unified ticket statistics
  - Recent tickets from all types

### 5. Navigation Updates
- `src/App.tsx`: Route changed from `/admin/demo-requests` to `/admin/tickets`
- `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`: Navigation updated to show "Tickets" with ticket icon

## Migration Steps

1. **Deploy Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. **Update Edge Functions** (if needed)
   - The existing `submit-demo-request` function will continue to work with the view
   - New edge functions can be created for contact sales and early access if needed

3. **Test the Implementation**
   - Submit a demo request through DemoModal
   - Submit a contact sales request through ContactSalesModal
   - Submit an early access request through WaitlistModal
   - Verify all appear in the unified Tickets page
   - Test filtering and detail views

## Benefits

1. **Unified Management**: All customer interactions in one place
2. **Better Analytics**: Combined statistics and reporting
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new ticket types
4. **Consistent UI**: Same interface for all ticket types
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Add date ranges, priority filtering
2. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple tickets for status updates
3. **Email Integration**: Send automated responses
4. **SLA Tracking**: Track response times
5. **Assignment System**: Assign tickets to team members
6. **Custom Fields**: Add organization-specific fields
7. **Webhooks**: Integrate with external systems
8. **API Access**: RESTful API for external integrations

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Removing the new routes and reverting to demo-requests
2. The `demo_requests` view ensures backward compatibility
3. The original demoRequestService wrapper maintains API compatibility
