# CV Upload and Analysis Flow Issues - Analysis Report

## Problems Identified

### 1. Step Progression Issue
**Problem**: Profile completion jumps from Step 2 (CV Upload) to Step 7 (Current Projects)

**Root Cause**: 
- CV Upload step (Step 2) completion is not tracked in the database
- The `loadEmployeeData` function has no logic to restore Step 2 completion
- When CV data is imported, it populates `current_work` section which maps to Step 7

### 2. Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Imported CV data doesn't match expected structure

**Issues Found**:
1. **Work Experience**:
   - Import saves: `{ experiences: [...] }`
   - Flow expects: `{ experience: [...] }`

2. **Current Projects**:
   - Import saves: string fields
   - Flow expects: array for `currentProjects`

3. **Completion Status**:
   - Import marks all sections as `is_complete: false`
   - Flow won't recognize these as completed steps

### 3. Generic Data Issue
**Problem**: Generic skills/projects appear instead of actual CV content

**Possible Causes**:
1. CV text extraction failing (returning empty/minimal text)
2. OpenAI returning placeholder response
3. Data not being properly saved to profile sections

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Track CV Upload Completion
Add CV upload tracking to the step restoration logic in ProfileCompletionFlow.tsx

### Fix 2: Fix Data Structure in import-cv-to-profile
Ensure imported data matches the expected structure for ProfileCompletionFlow

### Fix 3: Fix Work Experience Key Mismatch
Change 'experiences' to 'experience' in the import function

### Fix 4: Fix Current Projects Data Type
Ensure currentProjects is saved as an array, not a string

### Fix 5: Add Better Error Handling and Logging
Add console logging to trace the data flow from CV analysis to profile display

## Implementation Steps

1. Update ProfileCompletionFlow.tsx to track CV upload completion
2. Fix import-cv-to-profile edge function data structures
3. Add logging to trace data flow
4. Test with a real CV to ensure data extraction works
5. Verify step progression follows expected flow (1→2→3→4...)
