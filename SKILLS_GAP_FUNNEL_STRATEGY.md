## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete strategy for implementing a Skills Gap Analysis funnel within the LXERA platform. The approach leverages the existing backend architecture while creating a specialized onboarding experience that naturally leads to course generation upgrades.

## Business Strategy

### Core Value Proposition
- **Free Tier**: Complete skills gap analysis for up to 10 employees
- **Paid Tier**: AI course generation to close identified skill gaps
- **Natural Progression**: From problem identification to solution implementation

### Revenue Model
- **Free**: Skills gap analysis (up to 10 employees)
- **Scale**: $1/employee for additional analysis
- **Upgrade**: Full course generation and learning management platform
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for large organizations

## User Journey Analysis

### Complete User Flow

#### Entry Point: Skills Gap Landing Page
```
/skills-gap-analysis → Account Creation → Skills Setup → Dashboard → Results → Upgrade
```

#### Detailed Journey Map

**Phase 1: Discovery & Entry**
- **Discovery**: Google search, LinkedIn ads, word-of-mouth
- **Landing Page**: "Free Skills Gap Analysis for Your Team"
- **Value Props**: 
  - Analyze up to 10 employees free
  - AI-powered skills extraction
  - Instant gap visualization
  - Export detailed reports
- **CTA**: "Start Free Analysis"

**Phase 2: Account Creation**
- **Form**: Work email, company name, full name
- **validation**: Block personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
- **Account Type**: `plan_type: 'free_skills_gap'`
- **Immediate Redirect**: To dashboard for guided setup

**Phase 3: Guided Dashboard Setup**
- **Progressive Empty States**:
  1. No positions created → Create first position
  2. No employees imported → Import team members
  3. No skills analyzed → Send employee invitations
  4. Analysis complete → View results & upgrade

**Phase 4: Skills Analysis Process**
- **Employee Invitations**: Self-service CV upload
- **AI Processing**: Skills extraction from CVs
- **Gap Calculation**: Against position requirements
- **Result Generation**: Visual dashboard with insights

**Phase 5: Conversion & Upgrade**
- **Problem Clarity**: Specific gaps with employee names
- **Impact Quantification**: Cost in dollars/productivity
- **Solution Preview**: What courses would be generated
- **Upgrade CTA**: "Generate AI Courses to Close These Gaps"

### Strategic Journey Insights

**Built-in Viral Loop**:
- HR manager invites employees
- Employees see their skill gaps
- Employees request training from manager
- Creates internal pressure for upgrade

**Data Investment**:
- Time spent setting up positions
- Employee profile completion
- Complete skills database created
- High switching cost after setup

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Strategy

#### Database Schema (Minimal Changes)
```sql
-- Extend existing companies table
ALTER TABLE companies 
ADD CONSTRAINT companies_plan_type_check 
CHECK (plan_type IN ('trial', 'basic', 'premium', 'enterprise', 'free_skills_gap'));

-- No new tables needed - uses existing structure:
-- - companies (with new plan_type)
-- - users (same roles)
-- - st_company_positions 
-- - employees
-- - skills_profiles
-- - v_department_skills_summary
```

#### Authentication Flow
- **Same Auth System**: Extends existing Supabase authentication
- **Role Consistency**: Users get `company_admin` role (same as regular customers)
- **Feature Control**: Based on `plan_type` in companies table, not user role
- **Upgrade Path**: Simply change `plan_type` to unlock features

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
Account Creation → Company Record (free_skills_gap) → User Record (company_admin) → Dashboard Access
```

#### Backend Process Flow

**Account Creation**:
1. User submits form → creates company record with free plan
2. Creates user record linked to company
3. Sends welcome email with next steps

**Position & Employee Setup**:
1. User creates position → stored in st_company_positions
2. User imports employees → creates records in employees table
3. System generates invitation links for each employee

**Skills Analysis**:
1. Employees upload CVs → stored in document storage
2. AI edge function processes CVs → extracts skills
3. Skills stored in skills_profiles table
4. Gap calculation runs → updates gap severity fields
5. Analytics views refresh → shows updated dashboard

**Upgrade Process**:
1. User clicks upgrade → redirected to pricing page
2. Payment processed → updates company plan_type
3. Course generation features unlock immediately
4. User continues in same dashboard with new capabilities

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Strategy: Adaptive Dashboard
```typescript
// Single /dashboard route for all user types
// Content adapts based on user's company plan_type
// Same navigation structure, different feature availability

const usePermissions = () => {
  const { userProfile } = useAuth();
  const [company, setCompany] = useState(null);
  
  return {
    isSkillsGapUser: company?.plan_type === 'free_skills_gap',
    canGenerateCourses: company?.plan_type !== 'free_skills_gap',
    maxEmployees: company?.max_employees || 10,
    maxCourses: company?.max_courses || 0
  };
};
```

#### Key Frontend Components

**1. Skills Overview (Primary Landing)**
- **File**: `/src/pages/dashboard/skills/SkillsOverview.tsx`
- **Role**: Main dashboard entry point
- **Features**: 
  - Progressive empty states for setup guidance
  - Conditional blur effects for incomplete setup
  - Upgrade CTAs for skills gap users
  - Full analytics for all users

**2. Course Generation (Locked for Free)**
- **File**: `/src/pages/dashboard/CourseGenerationTwoColumn.tsx`
- **Role**: Premium feature showcase
- **Features**:
  - Preview mode for skills gap users
  - Full functionality for paid users
  - Upgrade prompts throughout interface
  - Mock data demonstrations

**3. Position Management**
- **File**: `/src/pages/dashboard/positions/`
- **Role**: Setup workflow component
- **Features**:
  - Available to all users
  - Required for skills gap analysis
  - Integrated with tour guidance

**4. Employee Management**
- **File**: `/src/pages/dashboard/employees/`
- **Role**: Team setup and invitation
- **Features**:
  - CSV import functionality
  - Employee invitation system
  - Skills analysis initiation
  - Progress tracking

#### Dashboard Onboarding Implementation

**Tour-Based Onboarding**:
- **Welcome Modal**: 4-step tour preview
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Step-by-step feature unlocking
- **Visual Guidance**: Spotlights and tooltips
- **State Persistence**: Resume tour across sessions

**Empty State Management**:
```typescript
const getEmptyStateConfig = () => {
  if (positionsCount === 0) {
    return {
      icon: Target,
      title: "No Positions Created",
      description: "Start by creating positions to define skill requirements",
      ctaText: "Create Your First Position",
      ctaLink: "/dashboard/positions",
      shouldBlur: true
    };
  }
  
  if (employeesCount === 0) {
    return {
      icon: Users,
      title: "No Employees Imported", 
      description: "Import employees to start analyzing their skills",
      ctaText: "Import Employees",
      ctaLink: "/dashboard/employees",
      shouldBlur: true
    };
  }
  
  // ... additional states
};
```

## Feature Implementation Strategy

### Permission System

#### Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
// Feature gates based on plan_type, not user role
const FeatureGate = ({ feature, children, fallback }) => {
  const { permissions } = usePermissions();
  
  if (!permissions[feature]) {
    return fallback || <LockedFeature feature={feature} />;
  }
  
  return children;
};
```

#### Visual Treatment of Locked Features
- **Soft Gates**: Visible but disabled with upgrade prompts
- **Hard Gates**: Completely hidden for internal features
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Features unlock as user progresses

### Conversion Optimization

#### Strategic Upgrade Triggers
1. **After Skills Gap Results**: "Generate courses to fix these gaps"
2. **Employee Limit**: "Analyze more than 10 employees"
3. **Export Attempts**: "Get advanced analytics"
4. **Feature Interaction**: Any course generation click

#### Conversion Moments
- **Primary**: After seeing first skills gap results
- **Secondary**: When hitting 10 employee limit
- **Tertiary**: After exporting first basic report
